        <p>Some people love donuts, but are they in love with donuts? In 2020 I launched a project called Doughnut Days with the goal of connecting donut-lovers to donut-makers. Sharing my findings was so well-received that I developed a small following on Instagram and Reddit. I created a website on Squarespace and the rest is donut history.
